Personal scripts to interface with Createc STM

./py_createc contains the main modules
./scripts contains useful scripts
which can be excuted starting in the top directory using e.g.
python -m scripts.osc.oscilloscope -z

To do:
- refactor list of z_off for tracking script
- make function to show current bias
- refactor pyFile for inheritance
- create a map script
